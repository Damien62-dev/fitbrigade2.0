    <h3>Why This App?</h3>
    <p>Passionate about running, and more recently weight training, I understand the complexity of creating a varied
        training program and tracking progress. I wanted to create a tool that simplifies and optimizes workout
        planning, while remaining 100% customizable.
        This application helps you visualize the muscle groups you're working and maintain a balanced training program.
