- Keep it public or private
- Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)

**b. Push your code to GitHub**
```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - FitBrigade project"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fitbrigade.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

#### 2. Create a Render Web Service

**a. Sign up/Log in to Render.com**

## Data Structures Used

### 1. Dictionary - Exercise Database

EXERCISES = {
    "Quadriceps": ["Back Squat", "Front Squat", ...],
    "Glutes": ["Hip Thrust", "Romanian Deadlift", ...],
    # ... more muscle groups
}
```

### 2. List - Workout Storage
```python
workouts = [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Leg Day",
        "date": "2024-11-22",
        "muscle_groups": ["Quadriceps", "Glutes"],
        "exercises": {...},
        "notes": "Great workout!"
    }
]
```

### 3. Custom Data Processing
- JSON file reading/writing
- Dynamic ID generation
- Muscle group frequency counting
- Statistical calculations

---

## HTTP Methods Implementation

- `/` - Display homepage
- `/create` - Show workout creation form
- `/workouts` - List all workouts
- `/workout/<id>` - Display specific workout
- `/stats` - Show statistics
- `/about` - About page
- `/delete/<id>` - Delete workout (redirect)

### POST Requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Application won't start locally**
- Solution: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed

**Issue: JSON file not found error**
- Solution: The `workouts.json` file will be created automatically on first run

**Issue: Render deployment fails**
- Solution: Check that `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies
- Solution: Verify `gunicorn` is in requirements.txt
- Solution: Ensure start command is `gunicorn app:app`

**Issue: CSS/JS not loading on Render**
- Solution: Verify `static` folder is committed to GitHub
- Solution: Check Flask's `url_for()` is used for static files

**Issue: Workouts not persisting on Render**
- Solution: This is expected behavior with Render's free tier - the filesystem is ephemeral
- Note: For production, use a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- User authentication system
- Database integration (PostgreSQL)
- Workout editing functionality
- Exercise history tracking
- Progress charts and graphs
- Export workouts to PDF
- Share workouts with friends
- Exercise video tutorials
- Rest timer functionality
